    "## White Balance\n",
    "\n",
    "White balance is the process of adjusting the colors in an image so that objects that appear white in person are rendered white in the image. It's about correcting color casts that result from certain lighting conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need White Balance?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Different Light Sources**: Different light sources (e.g., sunlight, incandescent bulbs, fluorescent lights) have different color temperatures, which can affect how colors appear in an image.\n",
    "2. **Color Accuracy**: Without proper white balance, images can have a blue, orange, or even green tint, depending on the light source.\n",
    "3. **Aesthetics**: Properly balanced images are more pleasing to the eye and look more natural.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does White Balance Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gray World Assumption**: Assumes that the average of all colors in an image is gray. The algorithm adjusts the image colors based on this assumption.\n",
    "2. **Color Temperature**: Cameras often have presets for different lighting conditions (e.g., daylight, cloudy, tungsten). These presets adjust the image based on known color temperatures of these light sources.\n",
    "3. **Custom White Balance**: Many cameras allow users to take a picture of a white or gray card under the current lighting conditions and then use that as a reference for white balance.\n",
    "4. **Post-processing**: In software, white balance can be adjusted after the image has been taken, especially if the image is in a RAW format which retains more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of White Balance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Natural Colors**: White balancing ensures that the colors in an image are true to life and natural-looking.\n",
    "2. **Improved Aesthetics**: Images with proper white balance are more pleasing and less distracting.\n",
    "3. **Consistency**: For professional work, consistent color balance across images is crucial, especially in scenarios like product photography or cinematography.\n",
    "4. **Flexibility in Post-processing**: Properly white-balanced images provide a better starting point for further edits and adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### White Balance Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Artistic Intent**: Sometimes, photographers might intentionally choose a different white balance for a particular mood or effect.\n",
    "2. **Limitations of Auto White Balance**: While many cameras offer auto white balance, it might not always be accurate, especially in mixed lighting conditions.\n",
    "3. **Loss of Information**: Overly aggressive white balance adjustments, especially in post-processing, can lead to a loss of detail in certain color ranges.\n",
    "4. **RAW vs. JPEG**: RAW images retain more information and allow for more flexibility in adjusting white balance post-capture compared to JPEGs, which have already been processed in-camera."

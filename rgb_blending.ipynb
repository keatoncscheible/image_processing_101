    "## RGB Blending\n",
    "\n",
    "RGB Blending refers to the process of combining the Red, Green, and Blue color channels of one or more images to create a new image. This blending can be used to merge images, adjust colors, or create various visual effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need RGB Blending?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Composite Images**: To combine multiple images into a single composite image, especially in applications like HDR (High Dynamic Range) photography.\n",
    "2. **Color Correction**: To adjust the color balance or correct color casts in an image.\n",
    "3. **Special Effects**: To create artistic effects or visual enhancements in graphics design and film post-production.\n",
    "4. **Transparency and Overlays**: To overlay one image on top of another using alpha blending.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does RGB Blending Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Channel-wise Combination**: Each color channel (R, G, B) of the images is combined separately based on a blending algorithm or formula.\n",
    "2. **Blending Modes**: Various blending modes determine how pixels from one image affect the pixels of another. Common modes include:\n",
    "   - **Additive**: The values of the pixels are added together.\n",
    "   - **Multiply**: The values of the pixels are multiplied.\n",
    "   - **Overlay**: A combination of multiplying and screening.\n",
    "   - **Screen**: Inverts both layers, multiplies them, and then inverts that result.\n",
    "   - **Difference**: Subtracts the bottom layer from the top layer or vice versa.\n",
    "3. **Alpha Blending**: Uses an additional channel (alpha) to determine the transparency level of each pixel, allowing for smooth transitions and overlays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of RGB Blending\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enhanced Imagery**: Allows for the creation of images that might not be possible with a single capture, such as HDR images.\n",
    "2. **Creative Control**: Provides artists and photographers with a tool to realize their creative vision.\n",
    "3. **Correction and Enhancement**: Enables the correction of color imbalances or the enhancement of specific color channels.\n",
    "4. **Flexibility**: Offers a wide range of possible outcomes depending on the chosen blending mode and source images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RGB Blending Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Color Space**: The color space in which blending is performed can affect the outcome. For instance, blending in linear RGB space might yield different results than in sRGB space.\n",
    "2. **Bit Depth**: Higher bit depth images can provide smoother blends, especially in subtle gradients.\n",
    "3. **Clipping**: Care must be taken to ensure that the blended values don't exceed the maximum allowable value (e.g., 255 in an 8-bit image), leading to clipping.\n",
    "4. **Performance**: Real-time applications, like video games or live video effects, require efficient blending algorithms to maintain performance.\n",
    "5. **Artifacts**: Some blending modes might introduce unwanted visual artifacts, especially when used aggressively."

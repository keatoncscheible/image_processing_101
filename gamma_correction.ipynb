    "## Gamma Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Gamma correction, often simply referred to as `gamma`, is a nonlinear operation used to encode and decode luminance or tristimulus values in image processing. It's used to optimize the usage of bits when encoding an image by taking advantage of the human eye's ability to discern more shades in the dark than in bright areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Gamma Correction?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Human Perception**: The human eye perceives brightness non-linearly. We are more sensitive to changes in dark tones than in bright tones.\n",
    "2. **Device Discrepancies**: Different devices (monitors, printers, cameras) have different responses to voltage levels. Gamma correction ensures consistent image brightness across devices.\n",
    "3. **Optimize Bit Usage**: By encoding images in a way that aligns with human perception, gamma correction ensures that the available bits are used most effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does Gamma Correction Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Power-Law Expression**: Gamma correction is typically applied using a power-law expression. For encoding, the formula is:\n",
    "   $$O = I^\\gamma$$\n",
    "   Where $O$ is the output, $I$ is the input, and $\\gamma$ is the gamma value. For decoding (or inverse gamma correction), the formula is:\n",
    "   $$O = I^{1/\\gamma}$$\n",
    "2. **sRGB Standard**: Many devices use the sRGB standard, which incorporates a gamma correction. The standard gamma value for sRGB is approximately 2.2, meaning images are encoded with a gamma of 1/2.2 (about 0.4545).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Gamma Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consistent Display**: Gamma correction ensures that images look consistent across different devices.\n",
    "2. **Enhanced Details**: By aligning with human perception, gamma correction can make details in shadows and highlights more discernible.\n",
    "3. **Better Image Quality**: Proper gamma correction can lead to better image quality, especially in gradient areas, reducing banding.\n",
    "4. **Optimized Storage**: Images stored with gamma correction can effectively use fewer bits without a noticeable drop in quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gamma Correction Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correct Gamma Value**: It's crucial to use the correct gamma value for the specific device or standard you're working with.\n",
    "2. **Double Correction**: Care must be taken to avoid applying gamma correction multiple times, which can distort the image.\n",
    "3. **Performance**: Real-time applications might require efficient gamma correction algorithms to maintain performance.\n",
    "4. **HDR Content**: High Dynamic Range (HDR) content might require different gamma correction approaches or other tone-mapping techniques."

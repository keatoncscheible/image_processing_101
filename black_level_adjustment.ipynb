    "## Black Level Adjustment (DC Offset Correction)\n",
    "\n",
    "Black Level Adjustment refers to the process of defining the darkest point in an image. It sets the baseline or reference point for the darkest possible tone, ensuring that this level represents pure black. Any pixel value below this level will also be rendered as black.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Black Level Adjustment?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Range Optimization**: By setting a proper black level, the dynamic range of the image can be fully utilized, ensuring that the image spans the full range from pure black to pure white.\n",
    "2. **Consistency**: Different imaging sensors or conditions might result in varying baseline levels. Adjusting the black level ensures consistency across images.\n",
    "3. **Noise Reduction**: Some of the data near the black level might be noise. By setting a proper black level, this noise can be effectively eliminated.\n",
    "4. **Enhanced Contrast**: Adjusting the black level can improve the overall contrast of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does Black Level Adjustment Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Histogram Analysis**: The histogram of the image is analyzed to determine the pixel value that should be designated as black. The leftmost point where the histogram starts rising can be a good indicator.\n",
    "2. **Thresholding**: All pixel values below the determined black level are set to black.\n",
    "3. **Linear Mapping**: After setting the black level, pixel values can be linearly mapped to ensure the full dynamic range is utilized. For example, if the black level is set at a value of 10, then a pixel value of 10 becomes 0, and all other values are adjusted accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Black Level Adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Image Depth**: Proper black level adjustment can give images a richer depth, making them more visually appealing.\n",
    "2. **Noise Elimination**: Unwanted noise in the darker regions of the image can be effectively suppressed.\n",
    "3. **Better Contrast**: Images often appear more vibrant and have better contrast after black level adjustment.\n",
    "4. **Standardization**: Ensures that black levels are consistent across different images, especially important in sequences or series of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Black Level Adjustment Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Detail Preservation**: Care must be taken to ensure that details in the shadows are not lost during black level adjustment.\n",
    "2. **Over-Adjustment**: Setting the black level too aggressively can result in a loss of information in the darker regions of the image.\n",
    "3. **Subjectivity**: The \"ideal\" black level can be somewhat subjective and might vary based on individual preferences or the intended display medium.\n",
    "4. **Balancing with White Point**: While adjusting the black level, it's also essential to consider the white point (the brightest point) of the image to maintain a balanced contrast."
